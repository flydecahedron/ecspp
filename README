ecspp
C++ Entity Component System utilizing boost flat_maps and a header only implementation

ECS implementation I'm using with SFML for a game I'm developing. Not done yet and will update
with usage info when done. Also doxygen documentation should follow shortly. 
NOTE:
This is for my own self study and will change drastically until I know wth I'm doing :)

checkout entityx, anax, kult, ecsos for other implementations
